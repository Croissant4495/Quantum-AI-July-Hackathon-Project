## Project Overview

We tackled the challenge of predicting key weather metrics—temperature, precipitation, and wind speed—using a hybrid AI approach. Team X combined **classical machine learning** with **quantum neural networks (QNNs)** to leverage the strengths of both techniques. Classical models, such as Random Forests, helped identify the most relevant features, which were then used to train quantum models using Qiskit’s `EstimatorQNN`. This approach enabled us to evaluate quantum AI’s potential in real-world regression tasks, supported by classical preprocessing.
